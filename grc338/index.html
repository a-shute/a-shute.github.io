            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p> The goal of Java club has always been to cultivate an enviroment that encourages creativity. In the past 20 years that we've been serving San Francisco locals, we believe we've done just that. When we quit our jobs as web developers in 2002 to pursue our dream of opening a coffee shop, we dreamed of empowering the community we love so much. We hope our space is place for you to relax, sit back, and enjoy some java (coffee & coding).  </p>
