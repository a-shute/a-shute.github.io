              Positano: Paradise with a side of Aperol
            </h3>
            <p>
              Italy's Amalfi Coast — a fairly isolated and dramatically scenic stretch
              of shoreline south of Naples — is blessed with beaches, sunshine, and picturesque
              towns spilling down precipitous slopes. Among these towns, I have a clear
              favorite: Positano, easily the most scenic, chic, and romantic stop along
              the coast's winding clifftop road. A breathtaking sight from a distance,
              Positano is a pleasant gathering of cafés and expensive stores draped over
              an almost comically steep hillside. Terraced gardens and historic houses
              cascade downhill to a stately church and a broad, pebbly beach. Many visitors
              come to Positano with only two aims: to shop the town's airy boutiques,
              and to bask on the beach. I've enjoyed both — but the town also has an
              intriguing history to explore. Stroll Positano with an eye past the glam,
              and you get a richer sense of this fascinating corner of the world.

              Known for its many festivals, Moorish architectural flourishes and, of

              Stepping foot in Lisboa was like falling into all the images of home tucked

              Alto neighborhood reminded me of more than one nightly romp among the Marina

              sprinkled throughout what is, arguably, the most beautiful city in the

              area as "el grande pais del sur"—the big country of the south. Anglo Californians
              of this century made it Big Sur.
