                  <h3>Lisbon: the San Francisco of Europe</h3>
                  <p>
                     Stepping foot in Lisboa was like falling into all the images of home tucked safely away in my memory bank. Even our hours spent sipping on Mojitos and Caipirinhas in the meandering stone streets of Lisbon's trendy Barrio Alto neighborhood reminded me of more than one nightly romp among the Marina bars oft frequented by yuppie San Franciscans.

                     Known for its many festivals, Moorish architectural flourishes and, of course, flamenco, the capital of Spain’s Andalusia region is a buoyant city whose many cultures are reflected in its cuisine, buildings, art and history.

                     South Africa’s sun-soaked coast lies ready, all-year round, to share its secrets, adventures and lazy days with you. With golden beaches and unspoiled nature, it’s more than just the place where the cool Atlantic and warm Indian Oceans meet. It’s 2500km of pure wanderlust.

                  <h3>San Francisco: Between Land and Sea </h3>
                  <p>
                     Tech money may be gentrifying much of this former nexus of counter-culture, but San Francisco remains an incubator of innovation—and not just in the city's start-up offices. California Cuisine was born in the Bay Area, after all; and the world-class museums and cultural institutions rival any on the planet—remarkable for a city of fewer than a million people. The adventurous spirit that made San Francisco what it is today thrives in the new restaurants, cafes, shops and galleries sprinkled throughout what is, arguably, the most beautiful city in the U.S.

                  <p>
                     These days, a new Ottolenghi restaurant opening or a new show at the Tate Modern is reason enough to book a last-minute trip. While you're there, we recommend balancing museum hopping with pub crawling, and hitting up as many markets as must-book restaurants.

                  <h3>New York: A World within Manhattan</h3>
                  <p>
                     To know "The City" like a local might still be the greatest badge of honor for travelers. But take a breath: you won't be able to cover the countless museums, galleries, restaurants, watering holes—and, yes, $1 pizza slices—all in one visit, but that's the good news. Now that the outer boroughs draw as much attention as Manhattan, it makes repeated trips not only possible, but essential.
