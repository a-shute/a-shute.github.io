                  <h3>Positano: Paradise with a side of Aperol</h3>
                  <p>
                     This seaside idyll is well known for its narrow cobbled streets, stylish boutiques, buzzy beach clubs, and cosmopolitan ambiance.  Positano rests almost vertically on the steep cliffside, with peachy pastel houses stacked on top of one another against zigzagging streets where local vendors sell sips of limoncello and colorful ceramics. At the bottom there is a pebbly beach where, if it’s warm enough (which it usually is), you can swim in the clear, turquoise waters of the Tyrrhenian Sea.

                     Positano is blessed with a mild Mediterranean climate and a proximity to luxury and wealth; it is home to one of the most famous and majestic hotels in the world and provided the backdrop for Diane Lane’s whirlwind romance in Under the Tuscan Sun.

                     Known for its many festivals, Moorish architectural flourishes and, of course, flamenco, the capital of Spain’s Andalusia region is a buoyant city whose many cultures are reflected in its cuisine, buildings, art and history.

                  <p>
                     Stepping foot in Lisboa was like falling into all the images of home tucked safely away in my memory bank. Even our hours spent sipping on Mojitos and Caipirinhas in the meandering stone streets of Lisbon's trendy Barrio Alto neighborhood reminded me of more than one nightly romp among the Marina bars oft frequented by yuppie San Franciscans.

                     South Africa’s sun-soaked coast lies ready, all-year round, to share its secrets, adventures and lazy days with you. With golden beaches and unspoiled nature, it’s more than just the place where the cool Atlantic and warm Indian Oceans meet. It’s 2500km of pure wanderlust.

                  <h3>San Francisco: Between Land and Sea </h3>
                  <p>
                     Tech money may be gentrifying much of this former nexus of counter-culture, but San Francisco remains an incubator of innovation—and not just in the city's start-up offices. The adventurous spirit that made San Francisco what it is today thrives in the new restaurants, cafes, shops and galleries sprinkled throughout what is, arguably, the most beautiful city in the U.S.

                     Everything about Big Sur is exotic, starting with its name. The Spanish Californios, in their colonial headquarters in Monterey, referred to the area as "el grande pais del sur"—the big country of the south. Anglo Californians of this century made it Big Sur.                  </p>

                  <p>
                     A city in southern Spain with grand Islamic architecture, free tapas, counterculture street art and a beer spa, Granada surprises and delights visitors. Many are drawn to the vibrant Spanish city for its show-stopping hilltop fortress, the Alhambra. But all are soon swept up by the fast, fun pace of life in the city.               </a>

                  <p>
                     These days, a new Ottolenghi restaurant opening or a new show at the Tate Modern is reason enough to book a last-minute trip. While you're there, we recommend balancing museum hopping with pub crawling, and hitting up as many markets as must-book restaurants.

                  <p>
                     To know "The City" like a local might still be the greatest badge of honor for travelers. But take a breath: you won't be able to cover the countless museums, galleries, restaurants, watering holes—and, yes, $1 pizza slices—all in one visit, but that's the good news. Now that the outer boroughs draw as much attention as Manhattan, it makes repeated trips not only possible, but essential.
